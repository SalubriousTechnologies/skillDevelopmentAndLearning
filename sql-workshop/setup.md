# Setup guide for SQL workshop session

## Pre-requisite

- Ensure you have docker installed on your system, for details refer to the [docker-session-setup](../Docker/setup.md).
- Ensure you have postgres database and pg-admin running in docker to ensure easy tear-down and re-creation of the databases as required, for details on setting up pg and pg-admin with docker refer to the [docker-databases-documentation](../Docker/databases/README.md).

## Setting up mock-data for use during session

- Execute the commands in the [db-setup](./db-setup.sql) file and you are now ready for the session! Good Luck!
