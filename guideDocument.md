## Topics around these technologies

- Security
- Performance
- Code Structuring
- Refactoring, Design Patterns
- Getting Started, important concepts and major bottle-necks
- Issues and solutions to getting around them
- Topics around generally better development practices or workflows or tools
- Database and ORMs
- Testing

## Modes of learning we will practice

- Writing blogs
- Open discussions, primarily based on an issue or solution
- Small repositories that can will be open-sourced
- Structured talks around a specific topic
- Code Reviews
- Creating getting started guides

The idea is for everyone to explore learning new concepts and to develop existing skills and knowledge by diving deeper into a subject that they wish to explore. And in the process help the team generate an appreciation or understanding for that technology, topic or language.

The idea is to keep things focused around practicality, so there are likely to be talks and discussioins around abstract concepts, behind the scenes of technologies, the idea is for everyone to try to bring those topics and discussion to the practical world using small live example/demos, small repositories for people to interact with. This will greatly help us ensure we are able to improve as developers at the end of the day through this exercise.

Ideally, people will choose 1 technology that they wish to learn and 1 technology that they wish to continue diving deeper into. However, this is not a compulsion, but it would be easier this way to manage with project schedules.

**Blog & Getting Started Guides**: These can be around a new topic or can even be on talks or discussions that anyone from the team gives. This will be ideal for people trying to learn the same technology.

**Discussions**: These are going to be structured discussion around topics where over 3 people can be active participants in it, so this can be around topics like getting started, development practices and tools or performance etc. that people can talk about from different perspectives.

**Small Repositories**: This will be the ideal choice especially for the new technology learners to showcase their work and to also have them available for the general community to use. Again these repositories can be then be talked about in a blog to explain further.

**Structured Talks**: These will be talks around a fixed topic that will make the audience take away something on that subject, the format details can be fixed a little later.

**Code Reviews**: Examples of refactoring, design pattern implementation and so on.
